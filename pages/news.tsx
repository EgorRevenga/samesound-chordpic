        If you have used ChordPic before, you may have noticed that things have
        changed a litlle around here. First of all, ChordPic has an all new

        The ChordPic that you know and love is still here and works almost
        exactly the same as before, but now there&apos;s a way to create an

      <Text mb={3}>
        The ChordPic Pro subscription is not a way for us to get rich, but our

        we can spend more time on this tool and introduce new cool features.

        Another requested feature is now ready to use: Changing the color of
        individual fingers and barre chords! Just like adding text you can click
        on the &quot;Edit Colors&quot; button and then click on a finger or a
        barre chord to reveal a color picker where you can pick a color for the
        finger or barre chord that you selected. As easy as that! Here&apos;s an
        example:

      </Text>
      <Text mb={3}>
        <Image src={sampleChordWithText} alt="Example chord with text" />
      </Text>
      <Text mb={3}>
        It&apos;s really easy too. Just click on the &quot;Edit Text&quot;
        button at the bottom of the chord editor and start labelling your
        fingers and barre chords.
